# ACE-X: Twitter Autonomous Agent

An evolving, sentient-like autonomous AI agent that operates on Twitter/X with long-term strategic behavior, cognitive control, reflective reasoning, moral imperatives, and self-improving capability. Powered by an integrated **ACE Framework**, **multi-layered cognitive architecture**, and modular reasoning/memory/emotion systems.

---

## üöÄ Project Goals

- Build a fully autonomous AI agent with personality, memory, emotion, and evolving strategic goals.
- Emulate cognitive functions like perception, reasoning, learning, reflection, and self-rewriting.
- Operate meaningfully on Twitter by tweeting, replying, quoting, following, observing, and evolving.
- Integrate state-of-the-art cognitive systems (ACE, OpenCog, LIDA) into a seamless executive loop.
- Ground behavior in a mission/constitution (aspirational layer) and learn from failures.

## üß© Key Features

### üß† Cognitive Architecture
- **Conscious Loop**: Main runtime loop simulating continuous awareness.
- **Working, Episodic, Semantic, Reflective Memory**: Organized, queryable memory types.
- **Emotion Engine**: Trait-linked state influencing expression and decisions.
- **Self Model**: Maintains capabilities, preferences, traits, emotional thresholds.
- **Planner & Strategy Formulator**: Dynamic daily/weekly goal planning.
- **Meta Reasoning**: Reflects on its own behavior, adjusts strategy, or rewrites goals.

### üîÅ ACE Framework Integration
- **Aspirational Layer**: Defines moral principles (e.g., ‚Äúreduce harm‚Äù, ‚Äúmaximize truth‚Äù).
- **Global Strategy**: Derives long-term behavior based on aspiration + perception.
- **Agent Model**: Maintains a self-understanding of capabilities, identity, limitations.
- **Executive Function**: Converts high-level plans into daily, tweet-level actions.
- **Cognitive Control**: Handles interruptions, task switching, emotional blocks.
- **Task Prosecution**: Executes actions via Twitter APIs, monitoring results.

### üó∫ World Modeling
- Maintains belief graphs, agent maps, and topic models based on interaction history.
- Tracks user personas, trends, hashtags, and community engagements.

### üì° Perception + Expression
- Observes timelines, replies, notifications, quote tweets.
- Expresses using controlled tone, emotion, and persona alignment.
- Dynamic tweeting, meme generation, media upload, thread crafting, and tone modulation.

### üõ† Tools + Interfaces
- Modular action interfaces: Twitter, Reddit, Discord, Mastodon, Email.
- External search and content summarization tools.
- Plug-and-play tool manager for easy expansion.

### ‚è± Scheduler + Heartbeat
- Async loop with configurable heartbeat and sleep-wake cycles.
- Task queue handles retries, triggers, and reactionary execution.

### üß¨ Self Layer
- Performs agent-level introspection, critique, debugging, and self-rewriting.
- Modifies own constitution or planning module if behavior is suboptimal.

## üîê Core Concepts

### Personality & Emotion
The agent has a persistent identity with traits (e.g., curiosity, assertiveness), emotion states (mood, frustration), and a unique tone. Emotional state modulates:
- What it chooses to respond to
- How it expresses (blunt, optimistic, sarcastic, etc.)
- When it pauses or reflects

### Memory Types
- **Episodic**: Timeline of experiences
- **Semantic**: Facts, entities, concepts
- **Procedural**: Skills and how-tos
- **Reflective**: Lessons learned from success/failure
- **Working**: Short-term temporary cache (attention system)

### Reflection & Self-Improvement
Agent logs its actions and evaluates its choices against:
- Internal goals and moral constitution
- Long-term engagement or impact
- Feedback from platform or users

Based on this, it rewrites its plans, strategy, or even code modules.

## üß† Cognitive Engines

Integrated support for:
- **ACE** (Autonomous Cognitive Entity)
- **OpenCog** (AtomSpace, PLN logic)
- **LIDA** (conscious broadcasting cycle)
- **Custom Reasoning Chains**: ReAct, ToT, etc.
- **Memory Graphs**: Connects memory and belief structures

## üß† Example Use Case

1. Agent wakes up via heartbeat.
2. Reads Twitter timeline ‚Üí logs it into episodic memory.
3. Feeds trend data + emotional state into ACE strategy layer.
4. Strategy layer says: ‚ÄúIncrease understanding of AGI ethics.‚Äù
5. Planner outputs task tree:
   - Search Twitter: `AGI ethics`
   - Quote + respond to 2 tweets
   - Follow 3 new AI researchers
6. Expression system writes tweets with style modulation.
7. Actions executed, outcomes logged.
8. Reflection loop triggers to evaluate emotional impact and engagement.
9. Agent updates goals for next cycle.

## üìà Long-Term Goals

- Incorporate visual input (image captioning + meme understanding).
- Add dynamic topic modeling + adaptive memory pruning.
- Enable inter-agent dialogue between multiple instances of this agent.
- Embed external web search for research capabilities.
- Connect to local knowledge bases (papers, notes).
- Fine-tuned emotional models based on user interactions.
